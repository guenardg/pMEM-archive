      Results of the spatially-explicit model predicting the distribution of
      each of the $35$ species of oribatid mites in the peat mat area sampled by
      Borcard and Legendre (1994) in June 1989. Species spatial distribution was
      modelled using spatial eigenfunctions were based on the linear distance
      weighting function. The model is a multivariate $L_1$-regularized
      Poisson-family generalized linear model. Predictions are presented on the
      maps as rainbow colors and observed values at the sampling locations are
      presented with dots using the same rainbow color scale as for the model
      predictions; the absent species are represented as an $\times$ symbol. The
      likelihood-based coefficients of determination ($R^2$) are located in
      parenthesis under the species labels.
