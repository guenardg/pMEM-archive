      Mean coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of the $25$ simulated random maps
      (two-dimensional pseudo-data sets; map numbers are shown under the stacked
      vertical bars) during the simulations and the different sample sizes of
      the spatial models obtained from the best distance weighting functions;
      the latter was defined as the one providing the highest value of the
      prediction quality metric for any map and subset combination. The maps are
      shown in increasing order of the $P^2$ for the highest sample size
      ($n=500$).

      Mean coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of the various random point subsets

      models obtained from the best distance weighting functions; the latter
      being defined as the one providing the highest value of the prediction
      quality metric for any map and subset combination. The subsets are shown

      Results of the spatially-explicit model predicting the distribution of
      each of the $35$ species of oribatid mites in the peat mat area sampled by
      Borcard and Legendre (1994) in June 1989. Species spatial distribution was
      modelled using spatial eigenfunctions were based on the linear distance
      weighting function. The model is a multivariate $L_1$-regularized
      Poisson-family generalized linear model. Predictions are presented on the
      maps as rainbow colors and observed values at the sampling locations are
      presented with dots using the same rainbow color scale as for the model
      predictions; the absent species are represented as an $\times$ symbol. The
      likelihood-based coefficients of determination ($R^2$) are shown in
      parentheses under the species labels.
