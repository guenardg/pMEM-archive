      Mean coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of the $25$ simulated random maps
      (two-dimensional pseudo-data sets; map numbers are shown under the stacked
      vertical bars) during the simulations and the different sample sizes of
      the spatial models obtained from the best distance weighting functions;
      the latter was defined as the one providing the highest value of the
      prediction quality metric for any map and subset combination. The maps are
      shown in increasing order of the $P^2$ for the highest sample size
      ($n=500$).

      Mean coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of the various random point subsets

      models obtained from the best distance weighting functions; the latter

      quality metric for any map and subset combination. The subsets are shown

      subset numbers are only cardinal).

      Results of the spatially-explicit model predicting the distribution of
      each of the $35$ Oribatid mites in the peat mat area sampled by Borcard
      and Legendre (1994) in June 1989. Spatial distribution was modelled using
      spatial eigenfunctions based on the linear distance weighting function.
      The model is a multivariate $L_1$-regularized Poisson-family generalized
      linear model. Predictions are presented on the maps as rainbow colors and
      observed values at the sampling locations are presented with dots using
      the same rainbow color scale as for the model predictions; the absent
      mites are represented as an $\times$ symbol. The likelihood-based
      coefficients of determination ($R^2$) are shown in parentheses under the
      labels.
