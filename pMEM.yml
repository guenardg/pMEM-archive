      Results of the analysis of variance of the effect of the sample size
      ($\log_{10}n$), distance weighting functions ($DWF$), maps ($Map$), and
      samples ($Sample$) on the coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of all the
      models generated during the simulation study. The analysis also included
      the second and third order interaction terms.

      Results of the analysis of variance of the effect of the sample size

      second and third order interaction terms, on the coefficient of prediction
      ($P^2$) of the models with the best distance weighting functions; the
      latter is the one providing the highest value of the prediction quality
      metric for any map and subset combinations.

      Maps of substrate types, shrub density, and topography outlined from
      Borcard and Legendre (1994, their Figure 1). The maps also feature the

      Mean coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of the different distance weighting
      functions during the simulations and the different sample sizes ($n$) of

      Mean coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of the $25$ simulated random maps
      (two-dimensional pseudo-data sets; map numbers are shown under the stacked
      vertical bars) during the simulations and the different sample sizes of
      the spatial models obtained from the best distance weighting functions;
      the latter was defined as the one providing the highest value of the
      prediction quality metric for any map and subset combination. The maps are
      shown in increasing order of the $P^2$ for the highest sample size
      ($n=500$).

    caption: >
      Mean coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of the various random point subsets

      models obtained from the best distance weighting functions; the latter
      being defined as the one providing the highest value of the prediction
      quality metric for any map and subset combination. The subsets are shown
      in increasing order of the $P^2$ for the highest sample size ($n=500$, the
      subset numbers are only cardinal).

      Results of the spatially-explicit models predicting substrate density and
      water content of the peat, which are defined as the mass (in grams) of
      solids and water per litre of uncompacted peat. Predictions are presented
      on the maps as rainbow colors and observed values at the sampling
      locations are presented with dots using the same rainbow color scale as
      for the model predictions.

    label: res_Oribatids
    caption: >
      Results of the spatially-explicit model predicting the distribution of
      each of the $35$ species of oribatid mites in the peat mat area sampled by
      Borcard and Legendre (1994) in June 1989. Species spatial distribution was
      modelled using spatial eigenfunctions were based on the power distance
      weighting function. The model is a multivariate $L_1$-regularized
      Poisson-family generalized linear model. Predictions are presented on the
      maps as rainbow colors and observed values at the sampling locations are
      presented with dots using the same rainbow color scale as for the model
      predictions; the absent species are presented as an $\times$ symbol.
      The likelihood-based coefficients of determination ($R^2$) are located in
      parenthesis under the species name.

      Relationship (on a $\log-\log$ scale) between the local contributions to
      $\beta$-diversity (_LCBD_) obtained from the $70$ observed Oribatid mite
      species counts ($x$-axis) and the _LCBDs_ obtained from the species counts
      estimated at the $70$ observation sites using the linear model involving
      predictive Moran's Eigenvector Maps ($y$-axis). The _LCBD_ indices was
      calculated on Hellinger-transformed predicted mite abundances for each
      $35$ individual Oribatid species observed on the
      $2.6\,\mathrm{m} \times 10.0\,\mathrm{m}$ peat moss mat area studied by
      Borcard and Legendre (1994) in June 1989. These predictions were obtained
      from a spatially-explicit model using spatial eigenfunctions based on the
      power distance weighting function. Predictions are presented on the maps
      as rainbow colors.

      Results of the spatially-explicit model predicting the distribution of
      Oribatid mites local contributions to the $\beta$-diversity (_LCBD_) on
      the $2.6\,\mathrm{m} \times 10.0\,\mathrm{m}$ peat moss mat area studied
      by Borcard and Legendre (1994) in June 1989. The _LCBD_ index was
      calculated on the Hellinger-transformed predicted abundance values of the
      $35$ individual Oribatid species, which were obtained from a
      spatially-explicit model using spatial eigenfunctions based on the power
      distance weighting function. Predictions are presented on the maps as
      rainbow colours. Coloured circles are the estimated _LCBD_ indices at the
      locations where the peat cores were obtained.
