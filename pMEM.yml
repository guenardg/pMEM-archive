      Distance-weighting functions, from @dray_spatial_2006, commonly used for
      Moran's eigenvector maps calculation.

    label: dwf_tab2
    header: >
      Distance-weighting functions usable for the generation of predictive
      Moran's Eigenvector Maps, which are based on the classical MEM framework
      (1--3) of variogram models (4--7).

      Results of the analysis of variance of the effect of the sample size
      ($\log_{10}n$), distance weighting functions ($DWF$), maps ($Map$), and
      samples ($Sample$) on the coefficient of prediction ($P^2$) of all the
      models generated during the simulation study. The analysis also included
      the second and third order interaction terms.

      Results of the analysis of variance of the effect of the sample size
      ($\log_{10}n$), maps ($Map$), and samples ($Sample$), including their
      second and third order interaction terms, on the coefficient of prediction
      ($P^2$) of the models with the best distance weighting functions; the
      latter is the one providing the highest value of the prediction quality
      metric for any map and subset combinations.

      Distance-weighting functions whose potential for spatially-explicit
      modelling was assessed in this study.

    label: Oribatid_map
    caption: >
      Maps of substrate types, shrub density, and topography outlined from
      Borcard and Legendre (1994, their Figure 1), together with a principal
      component analysis (PCA) biplot showing the sampling sites (markers) and
      Oribatid mites (arrows). The maps also feature the sampling points (black
      dots), open waters (blue area), and flooded areas (circumscribed by dotted
      curves). The labels at the tip of the PCA biplot arrows are the names of
      the eight mites with the largest axis loadings in their vicinity. The two
      PCA axes represent approximatly a fourth of the total variation among the
      sites.

    label: res_SubsWatr
    caption: >
      Results of the spatially-explicit models predicting substrate density and
      water content of the peat, which are defined as the mass (in grams) of
      solids and water per litre of uncompacted peat. Predictions are presented
      on the maps as rainbow colors and observed values at the sampling
      locations are presented with dots using the same rainbow color scale as
      for the model predictions. The substrate density model ($P^2=0.088$)
      is much weaker than the water content model ($P^2=0.25$).

    label: res_Oribatids
    caption: >
      Site loadings of a two-axis PCA over the Oribatid mite study area. These
      axes represent the two main components of the Oribatid mite community
      structure (representing approximately 25% of the among-site variability).
      Rainbow colors pixels on the surface of the study area are the values
      obtained from predicted counts, whereas the background color of the
      markers correspond to the observed PCA axis loadings.
