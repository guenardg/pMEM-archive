Remarks:
  - >
    Second and third derivatives featuring one-directional and two-directional
    spikes, respectively. Slope changes occurring at the points for equidistant
    transects, but may occur between the points for non-equidistant transects.
    In the 2D case, plane magnitude and orientation feature a similar behaviour.
  - >
    Curves forming ogee arcs blending into linear patterns as $\alpha$ nears the
    value $1$ (i.e. the linear DWF). Second and third derivatives are sharp
    two-directional spikes. Slope changes occur at the points for both
    equidistant and non-equidistant transects. In the 2D case, plane magnitude
    and orientation feature a analogous behaviour.
  - >
    Second and third derivatives showing one-directional and two-directional
    spikes, respectively. Abrupt slope shifts occuring at the points for
    equidistant transects and that may occur between the points for
    non-equidistant transects. In the 2D case, plane magnitude and orientation
    features a similar behaviour as do the curves in the 1D transects.
  - >
    Very similar to that of the hyperbolic DWF. Second and third derivatives
    showing one-directional and two-directional spikes, respectively, with
    abrupt slope shifts occuring at the points for equidistant transects, but
    may be occurring between the points for non-equidistant transects. In the 2D
    case, plane magnitude and orientation featuring a similar behaviour as do
    the curves in the 1D transects.
  - >
    Second and third derivatives showing one-directional and two-directional
    spikes, respectively, with abrupt slope shifts occurring at the points for
    equidistant as well as non-equidistant transects. In the 2D case, plane
    magnitude and orientation featuring a similar behaviour as do the curves in
    the 1D transects.
  - >
    In the 2D case, the SEF and all the derivatives are also 2D sinusoids, and
    this irrespective of point distribution.
  - >
    In the 2D case, the SEF and all the derivatives are also 2D sinusoids, and
    this irrespective of point distribution. The number of SEF tends to be
    smaller than for the Gaussian, at least for the 1D case.
